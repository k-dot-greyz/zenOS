## 🎯 **What This Proves**

This prototype demonstrates:

1. **VST Plugin Concept Works** - GitHub repos as plugins is viable
2. **Mobile DAW Interface** - Familiar patterns translate well to mobile
3. **Real-time Processing** - Plugin chains can execute in real-time
4. **Voice Integration** - Mobile-first voice input works smoothly
5. **Modular Architecture** - Everything is a plugin, even core features

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the prototype** and experience the interface
2. **Test the workflows** - install plugins, build chains, use voice
3. **Provide feedback** on what works and what doesn't
4. **Iterate and improve** based on real usage
5. **Build the backend** for real GitHub integration
