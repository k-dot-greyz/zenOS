## 📋 Quick Start

### Archive a Conversation
```text
# Manual method (for now)
1. Export conversation from Perplexity
2. Save to conversations/ with format: YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
3. Add metadata header (date, tags, status)
```

### Use a Template
```text
# Create new research session from template
cp templates/research-template.md conversations/2025-10-24-new-research.md
```

### Process Insights
```bash
# Extract and create tasks
1. Review conversation in conversations/
2. Identify actionable items
3. Create GitHub issues or zenOS tasks
4. Link back to conversation source
```
