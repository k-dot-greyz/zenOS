## 💡 Key Insights from Setup

### What Worked
✅ **Clear structure** - Everything has a place  
✅ **Multiple templates** - Different research needs  
✅ **Integration focus** - Not a silo, part of zenOS  
✅ **Philosophy first** - "Work as play" guides design  
✅ **ADHD-friendly** - Quick capture, process later  

### Opportunities Identified
🎯 **API integrations** - Perplexity, Gemini, others  
🎯 **Automation potential** - Reduce manual work  
🎯 **Plugin system** - CLI commands for research  
🎯 **Knowledge graph** - Link related conversations  
🎯 **MCP tools** - Deep AI integration  

### Challenges Noted
⚠️ **Platform fragmentation** - Each AI has different export  
⚠️ **Authentication** - Shared links often need manual access  
⚠️ **Processing discipline** - Need 24h review habit  
⚠️ **Index maintenance** - Manual updates for now
