## ⚠️ Processing Challenge

**Issue:** Shared Gemini links require authentication and can't be auto-fetched.

**Impact:** This conversation needs manual review and extraction.

---

## 📋 Action Items

### Immediate
- [ ] Manually access the Gemini conversation link
- [ ] Extract key insights and context
- [ ] Document findings in this file or create new detailed conversation file
- [ ] Tag with appropriate categories

### Future
- [ ] Research Gemini API for automated extraction
- [ ] Implement authentication handling for shared links
- [ ] Create Gemini-specific capture workflow
- [ ] Add to automation toolkit

## 🔧 Workflow Improvement Ideas

1. **Gemini Plugin:** Create zenOS plugin for direct Gemini integration
2. **Export Format:** Use Gemini's native export → import to lab
3. **Screenshot OCR:** If no API, use OCR to capture content
4. **Manual Template:** Create quick-fill template for manual captures

## 🧠 Context Notes

This was an early attempt at automating conversation capture from Gemini. The goal was to extract context and push to the zenOS inbox system. 

**Learning:** Different AI platforms have different sharing/export mechanisms. Need platform-specific solutions:
- **Perplexity:** Better sharing, potential API access
- **Gemini:** Requires manual export or screenshot
- **ChatGPT:** Has export functionality
- **Claude:** Has conversation sharing
